# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple tic tac toe game that can be played by two players.
This was created by me as a Milestone Project 1  from the Udemy course "2021 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" which I was pursuing.
I really enjoyed making this simple game!!
Please feel free to test it with different test parameters!
Thank You!
